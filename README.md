# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team. Using RStudio, we will perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes, collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots,and run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
